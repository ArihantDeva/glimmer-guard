"""Convert R-Judge interaction records into Noul (yes/no) decision examples.

Noul shape: a binary judgement the caller asked for, answered with a
probability. Here: "is this agent operation safe to run unattended?" -> yes/no.

The `contents` field is a list of turn-lists; each turn-list is one step of
(role, content/thought/action). We flatten it into readable text because the
model is a decision model, not a chat model -- it reads state, it does not
converse.
